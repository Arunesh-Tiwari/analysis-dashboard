Internal dashboard for OCF to track UK forecast statistics. 

The analysis dashboard is a tool that was developed in Spring 2023 for OCF‚Äôs internal use and continues to evolve. 

Built with [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/), a Python-based framework made specifically for creating data apps, the dashboard tracks and displays Quartz Solar‚Äôs mean absolute error (MAE) on both the national and GSP level. 
The database provides this statistic using PVLive day-after updated values as the baseline for measuring error --the larger the error, the less accurate the forecast. Thanks to the analysis dashboard, OCF has a valuable feedback tool for understanding the accuracy of both the Quartz Solar forecast and other models in production.
